# Survey App (Work in Progress)

## Overview

The Survey App is an ongoing project aimed at providing a full-featured survey application for developers. It allows users to define surveys, collect responses and analyze the results. I am using this project mainly to familiarse myself with and upskill on the Next.js App Router.

## Features

- Define and conduct surveys
- Collect responses within a predefined timeframe
- Tabulate and present survey results
- Two distinct user roles: Survey Coordinators and Survey Respondents

## Technologies Used

- React
- Next.js (App Router)
- TailwindCSS & shadcn
- PlanetScale (for database management)
- Prisma (ORM for database interaction)
- Zustand (state management)

## Usage

As this project is still in development, please note that certain features may be incomplete or subject to change. To get started:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Configure your environment variables, including database connection details.
4. Seed the database by running `npx prisma db seed`. This will create a survey with fake data.
5. Run the development server using `npm run dev`.
